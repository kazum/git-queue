This repository includes a series of bash scripts which help to manage
patch emails based on a Mercurial queues-like functionality.

The distinguishing features from other quilt-like tools are:

 - Optimized for managing patch emails; a patch name is automaticaly
   generated from an email subject, and git-am is used instead of
   git-apply to push a patch.

 - New and refresh are not provided for simplicity; we can do the same
   things more easily with git branch and rebase.

Example:

 $ git qinit          # initialize
 $ git qimport *.eml  # import patch emails
 $ git qseries -e     # arrange the patches in order
 $ git qpush          # apply the patch
 $ git qcommit -a     # commit the patch
